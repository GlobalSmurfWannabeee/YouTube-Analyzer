# YouTube-Analyzer
## Webapp to analyse your favourite youtube channels!!!
<p>
All you need is the channelID of the youtube channel.
This is how a youtubeChannel URL looks. The expression after 'channel/' is your channelID. For instance, 
      "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMRlJWmG6i7LP3TMSGpZVfw", 
'UCMRlJWmG6i7LP3TMSGpZVfw' is the channel ID
